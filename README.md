## Features
### Shopping List Widget
A shopping-list-widget that lets logged-in users view, add, and delete items from a shared shopping list. The list updates automatically when the widget loads and whenever changes are made, keeping everything in sync.
### Weather Widget
A weather-widget that displays real-time weather data based on the user's geolocation using the Open-Meteo API. It shows current temperature, wind speed, and location. The page may have to be reloaded for the data to be presented. Data from the outside temperature sensor may be added soon.
### UI Design + Carousel
Modern glassmorphic UI with a responsive layout. It includes a smooth sliding carousel that allows users to navigate between different widget panels using left and right arrows.

### üîê Authentication Integration
