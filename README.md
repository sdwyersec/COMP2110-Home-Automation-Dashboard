# COMP2110 Portal - Starter

This is the starter repository for the COMP2110 Portal front end assignment 2023. You are
expected to customise this README file to describe your own project.  You should update this
file with some documentation on your group's implementation.

## Installation

The project has no external dependencies, it uses Lit via a CDN load directly into
the HTML page.   Node is used only to run a local HTTP server.

```bash
npm install
```

Will install the `http-server` node module.

```bash
npm start
```

will run the server.

## Assignment

Details about the assignment and back-end server are provided in [this document](Assignment.md).
