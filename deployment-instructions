## Updating the Deployed Application
This project is deployed using **Cloudflare Pages**. Updates can be pushed by following the steps below.

### Live Site Link
You can view the deployed application here:

### How to Update the Deployed Site
After making any changes to the project code (e.g editing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or adding/removing files), follow these steps to publish the updated version:
#### 1. Ensure Dependencies are Installed

If you're working on a fresh machine or after cloning the repo, install project dependencies:
```bash  
npm install
```

#### 2. Authenticate with Cloudflare (only once per machine)
If not already done:
```bash
npx wrangler login
```
This opens your browser to authenticate your Cloudflare account.

#### 3. Publish the Updated Version
Run this from the root of your project directory:
```bash
npx wrangler pages publish .
```
Don’t forget the . — it tells Wrangler to publish the current directory.

#### 4. Wait for Deployment
It may take a few seconds to a minute for Cloudflare to process the update. Once finished, the updated site will be live at the same URL.

### Notes for Future Developers 
- All updates must be re-published manually using the npx wrangler pages publish . command.
- Keep dependencies up to date with npm install.
- Cloudflare Pages automatically replaces the old version with your updated code.
